    <h1>Electrocovection</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The electrical convection, or <em>electroconvection</em> in short, is the phenomenon caused by the application of a sufficiently large voltage difference across a thin-layer fluid such that the unbalanced charges are pushed by the applied electric field to form pairs of vortices of flows.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the physics experiments by Tsai et al., At room temperature the liquid crystal is at semectic-A stage so that the cigar-shaped molecules are arranged into layers. Within each layer, the molecules are aligned perpendicular to the plane of the film. Under such arrangement, the molecules are free to move along the film while movements normal to the layers are prevented, exhibiting a twodimensional fiuid.

        This thin-layered film is placed in between two concentric electrodes with the boundaries touching the electrodes. The inner electrode is charged with positive voltage <em>V</em> and the outer one is grounded. Inside the film the positive charges are gathering near the inner boundary, while negative charges gather around the outer boundary. Such unstable equilibrium can be easily broke by a small perturbation on the charge distribution. As a consequence, paired vortex flows merge.
    </p>

    <h2>Numerical Simulations</h2>
    <p>
        The simulation results are strongly dependent on the electric potential <em>V</em> and the aspect ratio between the inner radius and outer radius of the film.

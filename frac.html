    <h1>Fractional Laplacians</h1>
    <h2>Spectral Fractional Laplacian and Integral Fractional Laplacian</h2>
    <p>
        Two different types of fractional differential operators are considered: the <em>spectral</em> fractional Laplacian and the <em>integral</em> fractional Laplacian.
        The former is defined by spectral decomposition:
        the fractional operator \((-\Delta)^s\) for \(s\in (0,1)\) is defined by an eigenvalue shift of the eigenfunction expansion, namely, given \(v\in D((-\Delta)^s):=\{v\in L^2(\Omega) \;:\; (-\Delta)^s v\in L^2(\Omega) \}\),
        $$(-\Delta)^s v = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \lambda_j^s (v,\psi_j) \psi_j,$$
        where \((\cdot,\cdot)\) denotes the \(L^2\) inner product and \(\{\psi_j\}\) is an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions of \(-\Delta\) corresponding to eigenvalues \(\{\lambda_j\}\) which are organized in the ascending order.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second type of fractional Laplacian is defined through the Fourier transform on the whole space \(\mathbb R^d\).
        For \(v\) in the Schwartz space, the integral fractional Laplacian is a pseudo-differential operator with symbol \(|\zeta|^{2s}\),
        $$\mathscr{F} ((-\Delta)^s v)(\zeta) = |\zeta|^{2s}\mathscr{F}(v)(\zeta),$$
        with \(\mathscr{F}\) denoting the Fourier transform.
        The definition can be extended to the Sobolev space \(\mathcal H^s(\mathbb R^d)\) by a density argument.
    </p>

    <h2>Approximation</h2>
    <h3>Approximation of Spectral Fractional Operators</h3>
    <p>
        Consider the following generalized stationary fractional problem: for \(s\in (0,1)\), given \(f \in L^2(\Omega)\), find \(u \in D((-\Delta)^s)\) such that
        $$(-\Delta)^s u = f \;\text{in}\; \Omega, \qquad u = 0 \;\text{on}\; \partial\Omega,$$
        where the fractional operator \((-\Delta)^s\) is spectral.
        Kato proposed an integral representation to the solution \((-\Delta)^{-s}f\) with a complex Jordan curve running in the resolvent set of \(-\Delta\).
        A proper deforming of such contour yields the following so-called Balakrishnan formula,
        $$u = (-\Delta)^{-s} f
        = \frac{c_s}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \mu^{-s} (\mu I-\Delta)^{-1} f \,d \mu
        = c_s \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{2st} (I-e^{2t}\Delta)^{-1} f \,d t,$$
        where \(c_s:={2\sin(\pi s)}/{\pi}\).
        Following the above integral representation, the numerical approximation consists of two steps:
    </p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li> apply a numerical integral scheme on a set of quadrature points \(\{t_j\}\) and truncate the higher order terms; </li>
        <li> use finite element method to approximate \((I-e^{2t_j}\Delta)^{-1} f\) for each \(j\) on the <em>same</em> mesh. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Regarding the numerical integral scheme, we employ an exponentially convergent SINC quadrature, namely,
        $$u \approx u^{k}
        = c_s \sum_{j = -N_{-}}^{N_{+}} e^{2st_j} (I-e^{2t_j}\Delta)^{-1} f,$$
        where \(k\) is the quadrature step size, the quadrature points \(t_j = jk\),
        \(N_{+} = \left\lceil \frac{2\pi^2}{sk^2} \right\rceil,
        \;\text{and}\;
        N_{-} = \left\lceil \frac{4\pi^2}{(\delta-s) k^2} \right\rceil\).

    </p>


    <h3>Approximation to spectral inner product \(((-\Delta)^{s/2}u, (-\Delta)^{s/2}\varphi)\)</h3>

    <p>
        For \(u,\varphi\in D((-\Delta)^{s/2})\), the inner product can be represented by an integral
        $$\left( (-\Delta)^{s/2} u, (-\Delta)^{s/2}\varphi \right) =: a^s(u,\varphi)
        = c_s \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-2st}
        \Big(e^{2t}(-\Delta)(I - e^{2t}{\Delta})^{-1} u, \varphi\Big) dt.$$
        The numerical approximation to the inner product follows essentially the same two steps as in the spectral fractional operator approximation.
    </p>
    <h3>Approximation of integral fractional Laplacian</h3>
    <p>
        Consider the following model problem involving the integral fractional Laplacian: given \(f\in L^2(\Omega)\), find \(u\) satisfying
        $$(-\Delta)^s \tilde u = f \;\text{in}\; \Omega.$$
        Here \(\tilde u\) denotes the extension by zero outside the domain \(\Omega\).
        Unlike the spectral fractional Laplacian, there is no direct formula for the solution \(\tilde u\).
        In stead, the approximation is based on an iterative algorithm which monitors the residue.
        Consequently, the implement of action of the operator is required and can be represented by an integral
        $$ \tilde a^s(u,\varphi)
        :=\left( (-\Delta)^{s/2} \tilde u, (-\Delta)^{s/2}\tilde\varphi \right)_{\mathbb R^d}
        = \frac{c_s}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{st}
        \Big((-\Delta)(e^tI-\Delta)^{-1}\tilde u, \varphi\Big)_\Omega dt, $$
        with \(w,\varphi\) in \(\mathcal H^s(\Omega)\), the real interpolation space between \(L^2(\Omega)\) and \(H^1_0(\Omega)\).
        The integral formula suggests the following approximation strategy:
    </p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>apply the SINC quadrature scheme so that the integral could be approximated by a finite sum of inner products involving the solution to an elliptic partial differential equations defined on the entire space \(\mathbb R^d\), that is, solving \((-\Delta)(e^tI-\Delta)^{-1}\tilde u\) on a finite set of quadrature points \(\{t_j\}\);</li>
        <li>on <em>each</em> quadrature point \(t_j\), approximate the problem on the <em>entire</em> space by a problem with vanishing boundary condition on a bounded truncated convex domain \(\Omega^{M}(t_j)\) with \(M\) a positive constant; </li>
        <li>use continuous piecewise linear finite element approximation for each of the truncated problems.</li>
    </ol>
